# Student-Performance-Factors

In today's fast-paced and competitive educational environment, understanding the factors that influence student success is more important than ever. In this SQL project, I analyzed a database containing data on various factors influencing student success, such as study habits, sleep patterns, parental involvement, and access to resources.

The dataset we'll be working with includes a wide range of factors influencing student performance. By analyzing this data, we'll be able to identify key drivers of success and provide insights that could help students, teachers, and policymakers make informed decisions. The table we'll use for this project is called `student_performance` and includes the following data:
